# NecroCoin
App that track crypto currency price.

Learned how to get data from API, decode data with JSONDecoder.

Change the API Key in `CoinManager.swift` on line 36. in the array called `urls` to your API Key (I recommend using CoinAPI.io free api-key as i built it on their documentation).

Might change some stuff later, add new features.
